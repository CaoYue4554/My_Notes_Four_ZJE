- Monoclonal antibodies are a kind of therapeutic class; targeting cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases
- **Antibody Structure**: 
	- consists of variable light (V_L) and heavy (V_H) chains
	- Constant regions (C_L, C_H)
	- and CDRs: determine binding specificity
- How it works
	- **Antagonisms**: Blocking receptor-ligand interactions
	- **CDC-Complement-dependent cytotoxicity**: inducing cell lysis via the complement system 
	- **ADCC- Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity**: recruiting effector cells (like NK cells) to kill targets
	- **Signaling**: inducing direct signaling pathways

### mAbs -- Suppressing inflammation
- this function could be the way to treat autoimmune diseases
- Example: In MS, activated T-cells (Th1, Th17) and B-cells cross the blood-brain barrier, attacking neurons and oligodendrocytes.
	- Anti-CD20: targets B cells
	- Anti-CD52: Depletes T and B cells
	- Anti-Integrin: Blocks entry into the brain
	- Anti-CD25: targets activated T cells
- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
	- Characterized by "butterfly rash" and systemic organ damage caused by autoantibodies. The process is driven by ==apoptotic== material activating dendritic cells (DCs), which then stimulate T and B cells.
	- Target **Cytokines:** Anti-IFN$\alpha/\beta$ and anti-TNF$\alpha$.
	- Target **Co-stimulation:** Anti-CD40L to block T-cell help.
	- **B-cell survival:** Anti-BAFF antibodies to reduce autoantibody production.
	- Could also, expand the active Tregs, to release anti-inflammatory cytokines

### mAbs -- Stimulating, enhance inflammation
- Example: mAbs are used to drive the immune system to attack tumors, counteracting the immunosupressive tumor microenvironment
- In cancer: suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, by reducing MHC expression, increasing inhibitory molecules ==PD-L1==, increasing suppressor cells like ==Tregs and M2 macrophages==
- mAbs block inhibitory signals to ==restore T-cell cytotoxicity==:
	- Anti-PD-L1: block interaction between the tumor and the T cell
	- Anti-CTLA-4: block the inhibitory signalling during T cell activation
