### Crohn's disease
- ==Symptoms==: bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, failure to thrive in young; effects beyond just gut
- **NOD2 功能缺失变异** → 无法识别 MDP → DC 失控（过度激活 Th1/Th17）+ 潘氏细胞失职（菌群失调 + 屏障漏洞）→ 免疫系统攻击肠道共生菌 → 慢性炎症 → 克罗恩病。
- caused by Th1 / Th17 CD4+ cell intermediated response; can cause inflammation anywhere in whole GI tract
	- CD4+ T cells , IFNg, IL-12, IL-23 are all elevated in Crohn's disease
	- Could be caused by ==deficient regulatory activity== or ==excess effector function==
- Immune response to **commensal bacteria**; Gut bacteria are the antigen in Crohn's disease![](https://i.imgur.com/86PGvQf.png)
### Multiple Sclerosis
- defined as an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues
- Attacker: Autoreactive ==lymphocytes==, immune cells
- Target: ==myelin sheath== of the central nervous system (CNS)
- Consequence: destruction of myelin; progressive loss of neurons
	- vision problems and fatigue
- ==Hallmark==
	- Oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
	- **What they are:** These are specific antibodies (immunoglobulins) found in the spinal fluid but not in the blood.
	- OCBs expansion --> local clonal expansion of B cells, in CNS
- ==Trigger==
	- While MS is autoimmune, the slides present strong evidence that it is triggered by a viral infection, specifically **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**
	- **Molecular Mimicry**: a viral protein looks similiar to a human brain protein, immune system confused
		- The immune system creates antibodies to fight the EBV protein **EBNA1**
		- Self-antigen: These same antibodies cross-react with a human protein called **GlialCAM**, which is found in the brain (glial cells).
		- B cell will be the key attacker; CD9+ T cell will mistakenly recognize GlialCAM as a threat
### SLE: systemic Lupus Erythematosus
- a kind of systemic autoimmune disease; which means, unlike MS that only effect CNS, SLE is a multi-system disease
- Attacker: auto-reactive B cells
- Target: the whole body; highlight skin, joints, kidney, heart, and brain
- ==Hallmark==: production of high-affinity autoantibodies; particularly those that target components of the cell nucleus (anti-nuclear antibodies)

- Primary mechanism:
	- SLE results from a breakdown in B cell tolerance
		- **Central Tolerance**: eliminates self-reactive B cells in the bone marrow. In SLE, this process is defective, allowing more autoreactive cells to escape into the body.
		- **Peripheral Tolerance**: In SLE, all of these are impaired
	- Immune complex deposition
		- SLE is not caused by the antibodies directly attacking the organs. Instead, it is a consequence of forming **immune complexes**.
		- **Autoantibody production**: defective B cell tolerance leads to the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens like DNA and RNA
		- normal cell death --> RNA/ DNA release in blood --> antibody binds to them (antigen) --> form large antibody-antigen complexes
		- **Inflammation & Damage:** The deposited complexes trigger a Type III hypersensitivity reaction. They activate the **complement system** and recruit inflammatory cells like neutrophils, leading to widespread tissue damage and vasculitis.

- TLR & Interferon Loop
	- this could amplifies the autoimmune response
	- TLRs on B cells and DCs recognize pathogen-derived DNA and RNA. 
		- in SLE, they mistakenly bind to the patient's own DNA/RNA that is part of the immune complexes
		- --> after self-antigen binds to B cell, which will further drive B cell to produce more antibody
		- --> after self-antigen binds to plasmacytoid dendritic cells bind to the complexes, they produce massive amounts of type I ==interferon== 
		- **The Interferon Signature:** This chronic production of Type I IFN is a key feature of SLE. It promotes inflammation, activates more dendritic cells, and enhances the survival and activation of autoreactive T and B cells, further fueling the disease.


### AGS: Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome
- Definition: A mimic of congenital viral infection; caused by aberrant innate immune activation
- **Mutation**: cleaning up nucleic acids; when these enzymes fail, self DNA/RNA accumulates --> trigger the sensors via cGAS/STING pathway --> cause the release of IFN --> autoimmune disease

### COPA Syndrome
- **Mutation**: a defect in intracellular trafficking (Golgi-to-ER), The STING protein normally recycles, but now the transportation fails
	- Which will cause the STINg protein stuck in an activate state, leading to constitutive IFN production
