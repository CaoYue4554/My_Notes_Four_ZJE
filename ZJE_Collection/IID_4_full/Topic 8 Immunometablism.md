- Immunemetabolism: is about interpolay between metabolism and imunology, divided into systemic immunometablism and cellular immunometabolism

- Major metabolic pathways
	- Glycolysis: converts glucose to pyruvate for quick energy and biosynthetic
	- TCA cycle (krebs cycle): produce precursors for amino acids and lipids
	- Lipid metabolism: 
		- ==FAS==: fatty acid synthesis for membrane and signals
		- ==FAO==: fatty acid oxidation for energy
- T cell
	- Naive T cells
		- Maintain metabolic quiescence
	- T cell activation
		- undergo metabolic reprogramming
		- **Key Pathway:** The CD28-PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 axis is the central regulator, driving **glucose uptake and glycolysis**
		- **transcription factors**: drive glycolysis and glutaminolysis, and lipid metabolism
		- **Mitochondrial Changes**: rapid glycolysis; mitochondrial support nucleotide synthesis

- Macrophage metabolism: Polarization dictates metabolic phenotype
	- M1 Macrophages (pro-informmatory)
		- Characterized by enhanced glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species, which can help to antimicrobial role) production and nucleotide synthesis.
	- M2 macrophages ( anti-inflammatory/ repair)
		- Rely on OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Glycolysis is not necessary for M2 polarization.

### **Metabolites Act as Epigenetic Regulators**
This is the central mechanistic link presented in the slides. Metabolic intermediates leave the mitochondria and directly alter the epigenome, turning genes on or off.
