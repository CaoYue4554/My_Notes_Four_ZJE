	- What is ILC?
	- Innate lymphoid cells are the innate counterparts to T cells. 
	- They have similiar T cell functions but ==lack== the specific T cell receptor
	- Why do we need ILCs if we have T cells?
		- ==Speed==: ILCs have rapid response, as a part of innate immunity. They respond immediately to alarm signals (such as cytokines)
		- ==Location==: ILCs are **tissue-resident** -- Which means it stationed at barrier surfaces like skin, gut, lungs; while naive T cells circulate through lymphoid organs and must be recruited to the tissue after infection starts
		- ==Specificity==: non-specific, which means it can response to any stress signals and cytokines

|**ILC Type**|**Group**|**T Cell Counterpart**|**Primary Function**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**NK Cell**|Group 1|CD8+ CTL|Cytotoxicity (Killing) 1111|
|**ILC1**|Group 1|Th1|Inflammation (IFN-$\gamma$) 2222|
|**ILC2**|Group 2|Th2|Immunity to parasites, allergy 3333|
|**ILC3**|Group 3|Th17 / Th22|Mucosal homeostasis (extracellular bacteria) 4444|
|**LTi Cell**|**Group 3**|**(None/Unique)**|**Lymphoid Organogenesis (Building lymph nodes)** 55|

-  Group 1: 
	- ==Activated== by IL-12, IL-18
	- ==regulated== by **T-bet** for ILC1, and **Eomes** for NK cell
	- ==release== IFN-$\gamma$ , TNF
	- NK cell
		- They are the innate counterpart to **CD8+ Cytotoxic T Cells**. Their primary job is **cytotoxicity**—killing infected or stressed cells directly using granules (perforin/granzymes).
		- Kill Mechanism:
			- the balance: NK cells have both ==activating receptors== (to kill) and ==inhibitory receptor== (not kill)
			- MHC Class I: healthy cells express MHC Class I --> bind inhibitory receptor of Nk cell
			- Missing MHC Class I: activating receptor --> kill this cell
- Helper-like ILCs (ILC1, ILC2, ILC3)
	- These are the innate counterparts to **CD4+ Helper T Cells** (Th1, Th2, Th17). They primarily secrete cytokines to direct the immune response rather than killing cells directly.
- Group 2:
	- ==Activated== by "Alarmins" from damaged epithelium: **IL-25, IL-33, TSLP**.
	- ==regulated== by **GATA3**
	- ==release== IL-4, IL-5, IL-13
- Group 3:
	- Activated by **IL-23, IL-1$\beta$**
	- ==regulated== ROR$\gamma$
	- ==release== IL-17, Il-22
	- LTi are special; they are essential for the formation of **secondary lymphoid organs** (like lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) during development.

### Plasticity of ILCs
- ILCs can change their phenotypes in response to the environment
- ILCs can switch their groups, examples
	- Crohn's Disease: helper-like ILC3s can transfer to inflammatory ILC1s
	- COPD: ILC2s can switch to ILC1s producing IFN-$\gamma$
