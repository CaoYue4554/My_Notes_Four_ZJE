- Origin: 
	- ==Microglia==: most tissue-resident macrophages, including microglia, originate from the Tolk Sac during embryonic development. not bone marrow
	- ==Monocyte==: Derived from bone marrow --> develop to macrophage when needed
- Macrophage depend on CSF1R (Colony Stimulating factor 1 receptor) for survival
	- Ligands 1: **CSF-1**, the general ligand
	- Ligand 2: **IL-34**, for brain and Skin local macrophages


### In brain
- Microglia contribute to ==Synaptic pruning==: eat the weak connections between neural cells to refine the circuits; in a healthy brain, this is during **infant**
- Mechanism: complement Cascade
	- **Step 1 (Tagging):** The neuron marks a weak synapse with **C1q** ("Eat me").
	- **Step 2 (Opsonization):** C1q triggers **C3**, which coats the synapse.
	- **Step 3 (Engulfment):** Microglia express the receptor **CR3** (also called CD11b/CD18). CR3 locks onto C3 and engulfs the synapse.

### Autism -ASD
- Under-Pruning Hypothesis: lack of pruning will cause Autism
- If a mother gets a severe infection or inflammation during pregnancy, and let high level of IL-6 cross the placenta: incorrectly prune

### Alzheimer's Disease
- The protective phase
	- Microglia can clear Amyloid-beta plaques
	- ApoE can help microglia to recognize it.
- The destructive phase
	- Synaptic Pruning ==Reactivation==: the previous microglia synaptic pruning activated again
	- Microglia start eating _healthy_ synapses causing memory loss.
