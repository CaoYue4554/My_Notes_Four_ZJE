## Cell markers
- T cell's
	- CD3 (general), CD4(helper),CD8(Cytotoxic)
	- CD44(high in effector or memory)
	- CD62L(high in naive, low in effector)
- B cells'
	- CD19,CD20
	- Plasma cells (often CD138+, CD19 low)
	- Naive B cells (lgD+, lgM+)
- Neutrophils: Ly6G
- Monocyte/macrophages: CD11b, Ly6C
- pDCs: major producers of Type I interferons

## Overview of Cytokines
- Cytokines are signalling proteins that help control inflammation in body
- Types
	- **Chemokines** CXCL: which can direct immune cells toward infection part
	- **Interferons**- IFN: Interferons signal cells to put up their defenses against viruses invading your body.
	- **Interleukins**: IL-xx
	- **Tumor necrosis factor** (TNF): regulate inflammation in your body. TNF also signals to immune cells that kill tumor cells
	- **Colony-stimulating factors** (CSF): CSF signals hematopoietic stem cells to develop into specific cell types
	- ...
- ==Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory== cytokines
	- pro: trigger inflammation. Coordinate body's immune response to fend off attackers, like germs
		- **IL-1 (Interleukin-1):** causes **Fever** and activates blood vessels to let immune cells enter tissue.
		- **IL-6 (Interleukin-6):** causes the liver to produce **Acute Phase Proteins** (like CRP). It also causes fever.
		- **TNF-$\alpha$ (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha):** activates endothelial cells (blood vessel walls) and increases permeability. Excessive release can cause **septic shock**.
	- anti: lessen inflammation. Prevent an excessive immune respones that can lead to tissue damage
		- **IL-10 (Interleukin-10):** The primary "shut down" signal. It inhibits activated macrophages and reduces the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines above.
		- **TGF-$\beta$ (Transforming Growth Factor beta):** Promotes tissue repair (wound healing) and suppresses T-cell activation.

# DAMPs and PAMPs
- PAMP: 
	- Lipids/Carbohydrates: LPS, peptidoglycan
	- Nucleic Acids: dsRNA, ssRNA, Unmethylated CpG DNA
- DAMPs
	- intracellular proteins: S100 proteins; HMGB1
	- ATP
	- Uric Acid
	- Self-DNA/RNA

## Others
- Housekeeping genes: Actin or GAPDH
- ISGs (interferon stimulated genes): Mx1, Isg15, Rsad2, Irf7
