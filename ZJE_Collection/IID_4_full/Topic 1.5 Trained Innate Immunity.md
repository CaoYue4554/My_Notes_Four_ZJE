### Epigenetic reprogramming is the key for innate immune memory
- Chromatin go through changes
- Then, immunity related gene expression increase ![](https://i.imgur.com/mT57Dqd.png)
	- 1. **Chromatin Status**: promoter region of immunity related to immunity open
	- 2. **Histone modification**: H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3
	- 3. **DNA methylation**: fDNA methylation level in promoter region decrease

### Metabolic reprogramming
- After training, metabolic pathway change from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis

### Central and peripheral innate immune memory

|Comparison Dimension|Central Innate Immune Memory|Peripheral Innate Immune Memory|
|---|---|---|
|**Core Trained Cells**|Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors (e.g., CMP, GMP) in the bone marrow|Tissue-resident immune cells (e.g., tissue-resident macrophages, lung/spleen macrophages), NK cells, epidermal stem cells|
|**Training Inducer Target**|Inducers (e.g., BCG, β-glucan) reach the bone marrow through systemic circulation|Inducers act directly on immune cells in peripheral tissues (e.g., lungs, skin, spleen)|
|**Memory Transmission**|Heritable to daughter cells: Trained HSCs/progenitors differentiate into "pre-trained" monocytes/neutrophils, which are transported to peripheral tissues via blood circulation|Non-heritable to distant cells: Memory is limited to locally trained tissue-resident cells|
|**Functional Scope**|Systemic protection: Enhances the responsiveness of immune cells throughout the body to infections|Localized protection: Strengthens immune defense in specific tissues (e.g., lungs, skin)|
|**Experimental Evidence**|Adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from BCG-immunized mice (Kaufman et al., Cell 2018)|LPS-induced lung tissue-resident innate immunity (Cell Reports 2024)|
 
 - ==Central innate immune== memory relies on bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors, achieves systemic protection through heritable epigenetic reprogramming (with trained traits passed to daughter cells), 
 - while ==peripheral innate immune memory ==depends on tissue-resident cells (e.g., tissue-resident macrophages, NK cells), realizes localized defense via non-heritable local epigenetic/metabolic reprogramming (memory limited to local tissues) .
