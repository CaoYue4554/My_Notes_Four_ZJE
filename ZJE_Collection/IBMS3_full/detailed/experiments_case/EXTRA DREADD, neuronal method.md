Revised Experimental Design: DREADD-Based Investigation of Microglial Regulation of Sleep

## 1. Experimental Purpose and Rationale

This study investigates the causal role of microglial Gi signaling in sleep regulation, addressing a fundamental question in neuroimmunology: How do brain immune cells influence sleep architecture? We hypothesize that selective activation of inhibitory Gi pathways in microglia modulates non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep duration.

The experimental approach uses two complementary strategies:
- Chemogenetic activation of Gi signaling via DREADD technology
- Pharmacological modulation of endogenous P2Y12 receptors (a native Gi-coupled receptor on microglia)

## 2. Model System

We utilize adult mice (12-16 weeks old, mixed sex: 5M/3F) for several advantages:
- Genetic tractability allowing cell-type specific DREADD expression
- Well-characterized sleep architecture similar to humans
- Established protocols for EEG/EMG sleep monitoring

Transgenic CX3CR1-CreERT2 mice are crossed with hM4Di-floxed mice to achieve microglia-specific expression of the inhibitory DREADD receptor. Expression is validated using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.

## 3. Experimental Design and Methods

### Phase 1: Chemogenetic Modulation of Microglial Gi Signaling
- **Groups**: hM4Di-expressing mice vs. CreERT2-negative littermate controls (n=8/group)
- **Treatments**: CNO (5mg/kg, i.p.) vs. saline vehicle
- **Design**: Within-subject crossover design with 72h washout between treatments
- **Timing**: Drug administration at ZT6 (6 hours after lights on) during the mouse rest phase

### Phase 2: Pharmacological Modulation of Endogenous P2Y12 Receptors
- **Groups**: Wild-type mice (n=8/group)
- **Treatments**: P2Y12 agonist (2MeSADP), P2Y12 antagonist (PSB0739), or ACSF vehicle
- **Administration**: Intracerebroventricular injection via pre-implanted cannula
- **Design**: Between-subject design with counterbalanced treatment order

### Measurements
- **Primary outcome**: EEG/EMG-based sleep architecture (24h continuous recording)
  - NREM sleep duration and fragmentation
  - REM sleep duration
  - Wake time and transitions
- **Secondary outcomes**: 
  - Spectral power analysis of NREM delta waves (0.5-4Hz)
  - Microglial morphology via post-mortem immunohistochemistry

## 4. Controls and Potential Confounds

- **Genetic controls**: CreERT2-negative littermates to control for genetic background
- **Treatment controls**: Vehicle injections (saline or ACSF)
- **Circadian controls**: Standardized timing of interventions (ZT6-ZT9)
- **Sex as biological variable**: Balanced male/female ratio with sex as a factor in analysis
- **Off-target effects**: CNO dose optimization to minimize conversion to clozapine

## 5. Data Analysis

- **Sleep staging**: Automated scoring with manual verification by blinded observers
- **Statistical approach**: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA (genotype × treatment)
- **Multiple comparisons**: Bonferroni correction to maintain family-wise error rate
- **Power analysis**: n=8/group provides 85% power to detect 20% change in NREM sleep duration (α=0.05)
- **Data visualization**: Combined bar plots (group means ± SEM) with overlaid individual data points

## 6. Expected Outcomes and Significance

We anticipate that microglial Gi activation will increase NREM sleep duration and consolidation. This would establish a novel causal link between microglial signaling state and sleep regulation, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets for sleep disorders.

The complementary approach using both DREADD technology and pharmacological manipulation of endogenous receptors strengthens the validity of our findings by demonstrating convergent evidence for the role of microglial Gi signaling in sleep regulation.
