fluorescence polarization (FP) 
1. Fluorescently Labeled Ligand: A small ligand (such as a DNA sequence) is labeled with a fluorescent dye. Due to its small size, the labeled ligand will rotate quickly in solution, causing depolarization of light. This means that the light emitted after the ligand absorbs polarized light will not be polarized, resulting in low fluorescence polarization (FP).
2. Polarized Light: Polarized light is light waves that vibrate in one plane. When polarized light is used to excite the fluorescent dye, it will emit light in a similar polarization if the dye (and therefore the ligand) is not rotating or rotating slowly.
3. Binding Event: When a protein (in this example, ZnF456) binds to the ligand, it forms a larger complex. This larger complex rotates more slowly than the ligand alone. Slow rotation maintains the polarization of the emitted light, resulting in a higher FP measurement.
4. Increasing Protein Concentration: By adding increasing amounts of the protein to the fluorescently labeled ligand, the experiment can measure how much of the ligand is bound by the protein based on the increase in FP. The greater the protein concentration, the more ligand is bound, until a saturation point is reached where all the ligand is bound, and further increases in protein concentration do not increase FP.
5. Plotting FP Against Protein Concentration: The graph (labeled D in your image) plots the FP value against the concentration of protein. As the concentration of protein increases, the FP increases until it plateaus, indicating that all the ligand is bound. The half-maximal binding affinity (Kd) can be estimated from the point at which the FP is half of its maximum value. According to the annotation on the image, ZnF456 binds to the DNA sequence TGACC with a Kd of 20-30 nM, which indicates a relatively high binding affinity.
The graph shows three curves: one for ZnF456 motif (the specific DNA sequence it binds to), one for a different DNA sequence (23 motif), and one for a scrambled sequence. The strong increase in FP for the ZnF456 motif indicates that the protein has a high affinity for this specific DNA sequence. The other sequences show lower FP increases, indicating less binding. The EDTA control is likely used to chelate metal ions and thereby inhibit the binding activity of the protein, as zinc fingers often require zinc ions to maintain their structure and binding activity.
