## How the tutorial ask us to think...
- 首先，Hypothesis/ Experimental purpose and question？
	- Model设计相关--> Model system是什么？Cells/ Animals/ human population? Why Do they chose the model? Are there ethic to be considered?
		- --> Group setting:
			- Negative control?
			- Positive control?
			- Internal Control for normalisation?
			- biological replicates?
			- How to control the variables/ factors?
	- --> Measurement approaches是什么？PCR, WB, IF, IHC, Sequencing....?
		- Are there technical replicates?
		- Why to choose this approach?
	- 结果相关--> Experimental output: image/ counts/ numbers
		- Data process?
		- Quantitative or qualitative?
		- Statistical approaches?
- Pilot experiment: (Critical thinking part)
	- 是指在进行大规模试验前进行的先导的小规模的测试试验，验证可行性
	- Can the data be ==reproduced== independently?
	- Can they reproduce previous findings?
	- Awareness of potential bias?
	- Can the results be validated by an alternative approach?
	- How would you design it?


## 实验设计原则
- 这类题目可能是让我们解决一个生物学问题，需要我们设计实验流程和用到的技术
##### 1. 首先明确实验目的，核心问题
- To determine/ validate ....
##### 2. 技术选择/技术的详细情况
- 基因编辑和调控技术
	- CRISPR/Cas 9
	- CRISPRi/a
	- RNAi/siRNA
- 分子生物学技术
	- Western Blot
	- Co-IP
- 基因表达分析
	- Luciferase Assay
	- RT-qPCR
	- RNA-seq
	- Ribosome Profilling
- 染色质与表观遗传学技术
	- Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)
	- ATAC-seq
	- ChIP-seq
- 蛋白质相互作用
	- PIP netork analysis
	- Cross-linking MS
- 遗传关联和统计模型
	- GWAS
	- eQTL
	- Logistic regression model
##### 3. Control group setting
- Positive control
	- 实验中使用已知会产生预期效果的样本或者条件
	- Including a known enhancer region as positive control
- Negative control
	- 实验中使用不会产生目标效应（一般而言的）control group
- Internal control
	- 内部对照是在同一个样本中测量的参考因素，用于标准化实验结果。
	- Normalize Western blot results using beta-actin as a loading control
##### 4. Results and analysis
- What is the expected result? And how this can solve our problem
##### 5. Things to be noticed and optimization
- What could be the limitation?
- How can we improve?

Question 3. [25 points] The integration of different omics to identify markers for a complex disease ultimately leads to the correlation of molecular events. In one of the simplest scenarios the outcome could be the correlation between two proteins.

Suppose a proteomic study found that Kinase X highly correlated with the phosphorylation of protein B in your model tissue. Briefly, describe at least two experiments (in vitro and in cell) with their corresponding controls, that you would need to do to verify the observed correlation.

- 分析：需要证明Kinase X和protein B phospohrylation的关系
	- 需要设计两个实验，in cell and in vitro
- in vitro: 需要将纯化的Kinase X与protein B在含有ATP的缓冲液中混合孵育；
